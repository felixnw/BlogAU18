Today I went to a hockey game for the first time. I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a hockey game before this, but one of my friends likes hockey and invited me to come with him. It was a DC Capitals vs the Philadelphia Flyers game. He’s a Flyers fan, and I guess I was kind of supporting the Capitals because we’re in DC. Anyway, the Capitals won, 5-3, and it was fun to watch for the first time. I found it interesting how the ads were designed to use all the screens wrapping around the edges of the arena, and also the ones in the center.
